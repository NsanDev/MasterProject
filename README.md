# MasterProject

The *Script* folder contains the code that generates graphs and tables. In particular, *parameters.py* contains all the constants for the models and the parameters of the simulations. To generate the alpha surface in the folder *pictures*, just run the *main.py*. To generate the results for the four selected instruments of the master's thesis, just run *statistics_exposure.py*
